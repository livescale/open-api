This document is ment to help you understand the basical flow of a customer journey. The flow below represent the call made by Livescale to the server implementation during a Live Event. More detail can be found below the flow. 

![Livescale Shopping API Basic Flow](images/Livescale_Shopping_API_Basic_Flow.jpg)

1. When a person join the live event, the endpoint **/oauth2/token** is called with the *client_id* and *client_secret* provided in the Livescale Dashboard. The grant_type parameter will be, **"client_credentials"** to get the *access_token*, and **"refresh_token"** after receiving a token expired error. We expect to receive back an *access_token* and a *refresh_token*. This *access_token* will be used in every subsequent calls. The *refresh_token* will be pass in the endpoint **/oauth2/token** refresh_token parameters when the parameter grant_type will be **"refresh_token"**. The audience field will always be **"livescale"**. The Authorization section of this API specification is conform to the [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
2. When a customer start a checkout interaction, a Post /customers/login a call with type **"guest"** will be sent. Some e-commerce requires a specific *customer_token*. In that case the server will be responsable to link the *customer_token* and the *access_token* together to keep track of this customer.
3. The only type of basket supported at the moment is **"guest"**. The endpoint **/baskets/{basket_id}/customer** is typically used to set the email address on the basket.
4. After setting the billing address on the basket, a get **/baskets/{basket_id}/payment_methods** is asked. Only a **"LIVESCALE"** payment method is currently supported and this payment method must be returned by this endpoint.
5. At the moment only the payment method id **"LIVESCALE"** is going to be sent in this endpoint payload.
6. Livescale is doing the **Credit Card Tokenization** and **Authorization** on the Merchant PSP using the PCI-compliant Livescale's Payment Orchestrator.
7. The PSP *transaction_id* is provided in this endpoint's payload. This PSP *transaction_id* should be stored on the Merchant system for post order purposes such as refund.
8. In the Livescale Admin Dashboard the Merchant is able to decided to Capture of the funds later in their payment process. If Livescale is not doing the Capture the order, the flow will end there.
9. If Livescale is doing the Capture, the capture will be made against the Merchant PSP and a payment status will be sent. In the case of a failed capture, a reason will be added to the payload.
